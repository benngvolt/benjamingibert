<p><em>Nightingales</em> is a <em>musical fiction</em> in four tracks — a secret rave born in the heart of the trees, a place where chimeras and streams improvise together in a form of shared language.</p><br>
<p>It is an imaginary ecosystem composed of <em>concrete textures</em>, <em>pads</em>, <em>rhythms</em>, and <em>harmonic intertwinings</em>, a world to immerse yourself in for dancing.</p><br>
<p>The idea emerged from a walk in the forest, the day after a house music festival. In the contrast between the echoes of a festive night and the morning stillness, a question arose: <em>what if I created my own sanctuary for dancing?</em></p><br>
<p>Fragments inherited from the electronic scene of the ’90s and 2000s emerge here: patterns borrowed from <em>house</em>, <em>IDM</em>, <em>UK garage</em>, leading to a <em>futuristic vocal polyphony</em> before sunrise.</p><br>
<p>A distinctive feature of the EP is the gradual emergence of the <em>human voice</em>, without words or language, in the form of <em>phonemes</em>, <em>breaths</em>, and <em>improvised fragments</em>. Used as <em>raw material</em>, it slowly infiltrates the tracks, not to signify, but simply to resonate with the other elements.</p><br>
<p>The <em>nightingale</em>, the emblematic bird of the title, is known for its nocturnal song. Here, it becomes the symbol of a <em>liminal space</em> — between wakefulness and sleep, between nature and synthesis.</p>
