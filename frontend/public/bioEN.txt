<p>Benjamin Gibert ventures into mountains, forests, and megacities in search of hidden sounds and sonic wanderings. He gathers raw sound matter — using a microphone and a notebook — then plays with layering, fusing, fragmenting, and recombining these sounds. His sonic objects flirt with acoustic and electronic instruments, organize into abstract narratives, and open the doors to invisible worlds. His work aims to create immersive forms where reality and imagination, landscapes and fiction coexist.</p><br>

<p>Coming from a background in contemporary dance, he develops a physical and spatial approach to sound — conceived for deep listening and movement. Field recording is his primary tool, which he blends with electronic textures, evolving rhythmic structures, and a unique use of the voice: without words or language, treated simply as raw, vibrant, organic matter.</p><br>

<p>He has undertaken numerous residencies in France, New Zealand, and Chile, and has presented his work on tour in France, Spain, and Japan.</p><br>

<p>He released <em>Gemmes</em> (2018), an EP composed for the Royal Abbey of Fontevraud; then <em>Taihua</em> (2019), an album conceived and produced in New Zealand. His upcoming EP, <em>Nightingales</em>, will be released in summer 2025. It is a musical fiction at the crossroads of IDM, organic house, and ambient — imagining what a secret forest rave might sound like.</p><br>

<p>Benjamin Gibert’s work stands out for the way it connects places, natural sounds, and electronic textures. He is drawn to liminal spaces — between wakefulness and sleep, human and non-human, natural and synthetic. His universe is nourished by influences ranging from Oneohtrix Point Never to A.G. Cook, via Steve Reich, Björk, and D’Eon.</p><br>
