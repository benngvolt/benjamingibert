<p><em>Glassbirds II</em> sounds like a gradual awakening at nightfall. Glass birds fly through the canopy, shattering and reforming in a shimmering sonic environment — a word that guided the entire composition, from sound design to the track's dynamics.</p><br>
<p>The track is built on a framework of melodic patterns created from glass impacts and shards, laid over a rhythm that starts off simple and binary. This raw material, left aside for a long time, was later entirely reworked: the initial pulse gave way to a more fluid, syncopated rhythm inspired by UK garage patterns.</p><br>
<p>The DX7 synthesizer steers the piece toward a Frutiger Aero aesthetic, creating a play of contrasts with natural and organic sounds. The track gradually shifts toward a more assertive form, culminating in a conclusion clearly shaped by house music codes.</p><br>
<p>Halfway between the organic and the programmatic, <em>Glassbirds II</em> explores the mutation of materials — a chimera of genres.</p><br>
