<p><em>Aspérité Liquide</em> is the most clearly <em>organic house</em> track on the EP. Two elements form its foundation: <em>xylophone</em> patterns played on a handmade instrument found at a flea market, and <em>sliding synth</em> loops that open the piece. These two layers shape a soundscape that evokes a forest crossed by a stream.</p><br>

<p>Once this setting is established, the track evolves in successive touches, gradually referencing ’90s <em>house</em> more explicitly — with a gimmick reminiscent of <em>Crystal Waters</em> or <em>Robyn S.</em>, followed by a bassline that reinforces the groove.</p><br>

<p>The rhythm relies on a combination of <em>TR-808</em> and <em>field recordings</em>, captured from natural materials collected in the forest. The piece is punctuated by <em>pitched birds</em> and <em>ghostly choirs</em>, evoking ambiguous life forms.</p><br>

<p>The different layers slide over one another like water, without rigid structure. The result is a sense of fluid continuity.</p><br>

<p>As with the rest of the EP, the approach remains the same: set an environment, settle into it, and let the dance emerge from within.</p><br>
