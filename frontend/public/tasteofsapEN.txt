<p><em>Taste of Sap</em> is an immersive vocal experiment, born from a long improvisation session with a harmonizer. The title is sensual — it means “the taste of sap.” The track gradually thickens, like sap itself: fluid, viscous, enveloping. Conceived as an end-of-night chant around a fire, it searches, finds form, and eventually becomes a ceremonial anthem at dawn.</p><br>

<p>No language is used: only raw vocal material, spontaneous, organic phonemes that emerge viscerally. The voice is the main musical instrument.</p><br>

<p>A small vintage, portable Casio synthesizer punctuates the whole piece in playful dialogue with the vocal improvisations. <em>Taste of Sap</em> evokes a primal, ancestral imaginary and prepares the arrival of the sun at daybreak.</p><br>
