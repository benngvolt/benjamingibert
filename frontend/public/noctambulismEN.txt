<p><em>Noctambulism</em> is arguably the most grounded track on the EP, rooted in a lush, fictional jungle. It opens with a soundscape of birds and insects, recorded in various real-world locations and then drastically transformed — pitched, multiplied, and phase-shifted to create a surreal and uncanny environment.</p><br>

<p>This living mass becomes an autonomous space, a sonic ecosystem crossed by organic sound objects. A modified citation from the track <em>Tui’s Garden</em> (from the previous album <em>Taihua</em>) acts as an anchor — pitched downward, it functions like the memory of a living organism that has mutated.</p><br>

<p>At the heart of this sci-fi setting lies a subtle, continuous rhythmic motif — a fake maraca crafted from insect sounds — slowly leading into the second part. More structured and melodic, this section reintroduces DX7 pads and harmonic experiments derived from field recordings, forming a kind of immersive trance.</p><br>

<p>At the intersection of field recording, IDM, and synthwave, <em>Noctambulism</em> charts a slower path through the forest — just before the dance resumes in the next track.</p><br>
